requirements:
1. portable
packets written on one operating system should be read correctly on another operating system that has a different endian.

2. easy to debug
packet writing is error-prone. The library should report an error when the user tries to extract the data with a type that is not compatible with the original type.




design:

Use boost::serialization

implement a portable binary archive and a sub-class of ostream that streams to a buffer

in debug mode, size of primitive types will be written to the pakcet
