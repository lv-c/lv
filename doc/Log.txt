design:
1. syntax:
log(Log::error) << "hello world" << 22;

log(Log::error) returns a proxy object

2. sinks:
subclasses of std::ostream
boost::iostreams library will easy the task of creating new streams


3. thread-safe
acquire the lock at the beginning of one record and release it at the end of this record.

4.
